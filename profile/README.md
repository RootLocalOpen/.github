## Our Mission

> RootLocal builds modern, local-first apps designed to run where you operate — your LAN, your hardware, your rules.

We believe in building tools that are:
- **Offline-friendly** and fast
- **Modular** and hackable
- **Respectful of user privacy**
- **Accessible across devices**: desktop, mobile, web
